This package is exclusively available via the GitHub registry. To install github registry npm packages, follow these  [instruccions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#installing-a-package) Alternatively, you can handle .env variables using your preferred method.
